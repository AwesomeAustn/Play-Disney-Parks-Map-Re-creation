The X and Y coordinates for the icons were off by 3 times of the blank map. Instead of shrinking the map, I multiplied each icon's X and Y by 3 to keep the map at its original size.

I used the plugin Bodymovin for Adobe After Effects to save a screenshot of the animated LottieFiles to an SVG. I had to modify a few SVGs because of overlapping and some elements were shown when they weren't suppose to. Individual curves made this doable. I also had to multiply the size of the SVGs by 3 to keep the size relative to the map. I chose the height value to keep it all consistent, except for the floating mountains in dak. I used the width because they line up better with the shadows on the background. The JSON file had PNGs of animations which don't exist. I just added them anyways as (Missing) to keep it the same as the JSON file. They are not missing, just a duplicate to the ANIM ones.

The holiday files were already included in the files. I did not modify those.

I made a few minor location and layer changes to some icons because I thought they were a bit or off or look better. I flipped the Colombia Ship and the right Jungle Cruise boat. I hid a few icons because they were either overlapping an identical non-animated screenshot, or missing an element, such as a flag pole to the flag. They may be in the resources folder, but they weren't in the JSON file, or I missed them. These are still included in the Affinity Photo file.
