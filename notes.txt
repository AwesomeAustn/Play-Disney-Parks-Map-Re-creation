App Version: 2.21.2

The X and Y coordinates for the icons were off by 3 times of the blank map. Instead of shrinking the map, I multiplied each icon's X and Y by 3 to keep the map at its original size.

I used the plugin Bodymovin for Adobe After Effects to save a screenshot of the animated LottieFiles to an SVG. I had to modify a few SVGs because of overlapping and some elements were shown when they weren't suppose to. Individual curves made this doable. I also had to multiply the size of the SVGs by 3 to keep the size relative to the map. I chose the height value to keep it all consistent.

The holiday files were already included in the files. I did not modify that one.

I made a few minor location changes to some icons because I thought they were a bit off.
I flipped the Colombia Ship and the right Jungle Cruise boat for the correct direction.
I hid a few icons because they were either overlapping an identical non-animated screenshot, or missing an element, such as a flag pole to the flag. These are still included in the Affinity Photo file.
